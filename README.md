<h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
<p>As a Computer Science alumni at Queens College, I am passionate about learning and applying new technologies to create engaging and innovative web solutions. I graduated in May 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a strong foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. <br /><br />
I have gained valuable hands-on experience in web development and analysis through multiple internships in different domains. Most recently, I was a Social Media Intern at CCNY Grove School of Engineering, where I analyzed the engagement of users on two platforms using REST APIs and web scrapers, inspected the design of the platforms based on web design principles, and collaborated with co-workers to create daily Instagram posts. I also have experience in media technology and digital arts, where I managed websites using WordPress, enhanced web attraction and subscription using APIs, and worked with Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver tools. <br /><br />
I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have earned certifications in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Dreamweaver, and Java from reputable organizations. I am also familiar with C++, WordPress, and HTTP. I am eager to expand my skills and knowledge in web development and software engineering, and to contribute to meaningful and challenging projects in the field. I am looking for entry-level opportunities that will allow me to grow as a professional and as a lifelong learner. </p>
